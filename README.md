## Assignment 3 - SVG Logo Design

Katherine Kapiga

## Description of design concept
Client is a gemcutter. Due to the angular shapes of cut gems, I went with a fairly straightforward logo concept of a diamond shape "cut" with angular patterns. For demonstrative purposes of each logo in action, this webpage provides two mockup headers.

## Journal Entry
**Comments, observations:** Though I had an approach for the design in mind, the final logo was honestly more a product of trying many different ideas and fiddling with figma before landing on something that I thought looked cool. I think I suffered a bit by not trying out Figma enough in my free time, as I had to learn some quirks of the tool on the fly and reference tutorials.

A sample of screenshots from my design process can be found in [this folder](assets/images/logo-design-process).

**Problems encountered:** Many. It took some time for me to make the logo - the first iteration honestly became a mess of polygons and paths and I thought it best that I just start fresh once I had a more solid idea in mind. I also had a fair bit of trouble exporting a transparent SVG properly, as I didn't realize that Figma was exporting the frame's background until I tried building my page. I also had to modify the SVG to account for the lost background, as the look of my exclude layer was dependent on a white backdrop. Furthermore, I had some trouble with page layout breaking, which was solved by wrapping the SVGs in a div container.
